Hi! I'm Varun Haldhar. Glad to see you here!

I'm a software developer from Bihar, India. Between 2016 and 2019, I gained a great interest in programming during my education at B.R.A.B. University Computer Science Department and after my graduation. In 2019, I joined online learning platform AttainU in order to turn this interest into a professional and gain Full Stack Developer(MERN) Certificate in 2020.

At Softregent Technologies - Pune, where I started working as an full time employee after completing AttainU, I continued to work for 1 years until I became a mid-level software developer. At Softregent, I took a role in the development of enterprise web and backend APIs with the help of technologies/tools such as JavaScript, NodeJS, React, MYSQL, MongoDB and Git in a team that follows the Agile/Scrum methodologies.

As of September 2021, I started to work as a Full Stack Developer(MERN) in the team of Antier Solutions. I had mostly working on JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, NodeJS, GRPC, Web3, Docker and similar frontend and backend technologies.

After Antier Solutions, I joined Simplilearn Solutions - Bengaluru as a Software Developer Engineer - (SDE-2). I'm mostly working on APIs Integration and building dynamic Subdomain Pages in ReactJs, NodeJS & PHP frameworks. Aslo I collabarated with the product team to implement new features and strategically plan for future products.

In my spare time, I contribute to my own development by carrying out projects with technologies such as Node.js (Express, Next.js, Socket.IO etc.), (Selinium, BS4, Scraping) Python projects, Blockchain, Web3 and I try to take part in the open-source community by publishing these projects on GitHub.

I also develop small-scale projects in languages ​​such as Python and Solidty, as I believe that experiencing different frameworks and programming languages ​​can bring different perspectives to a software developer.
